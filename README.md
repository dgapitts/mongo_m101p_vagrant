Introduction
------------

    This repository started with my notes and vagrant build scripts and homework for the m101p ("mongo for python developers").
    I have gone to use and extend this for homework and coursework for m102 ("mongo for DBAs") and m101js ("mongo for node.js developers) 


Instructions
-------------

     git clone git://github.com/dgapitts/mongo_m101p_vagrant.git
     cd mongo_m101p_vagrant
     vagrant up


ToDo
----

    Investigate why the port forwarding doesn't currently work with bottle ("Fast and simple WSGI-framework for small web-applications"), which is WebApp webserver/middleware used in m101p.
    Interestingly this port forwarding does work for the node webserver/middleware used in m101js.
