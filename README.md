Introduction
------------

This repository started with my notes and vagrant build scripts and homework for the m101p ("mongo for python developers").
I have gone to use and extend this for homework and coursework for m102 ("mongo for DBAs") and m101js ("mongo for node.js developers) 


Instructions
-------------

     git clone git://github.com/dgapitts/mongo_m101p_vagrant.git
     cd mongo_m101p_vagrant
     vagrant up


ToDo
----

Investigate why the port forwarding doesn't currently work with bottle ("Fast and simple WSGI-framework for small web-applications"), which is WebApp webserver/middleware used in m101p.

Interestingly this port forwarding does work for the node webserver/middleware used in m101js.


Spoilers Alert!?
----------------

This repository contains my work, the scripts and json files used throughout these causes. Most of the homework answers are not in this repository (I have all my anwsers in private google docs), but in one or two cases there are some potential spoilers. However as most of the answers now appear to be readibly available on Stackoverflow/Blogs/YouTube there are many better indexed and better documented way to cheat on these exams.

This repository is an aid for myself with some of work and the background scripts and json files if and when I want to work through the examples again. 

This may be of interest for others doing this course... but of course you get out of these courses what you put in ;)
