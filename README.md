Introduction
------------

This repository started with my notes and vagrant build scripts and homework for the m101p ("mongo for python developers").
I have gone to use and extend this for homework and coursework for m102 ("mongo for DBAs") and m101js ("mongo for node.js developers) 


Instructions
-------------

     git clone git://github.com/dgapitts/mongo_m101p_vagrant.git
     cd mongo_m101p_vagrant
     vagrant up


ToDo
----

Investigate why the port forwarding doesn't currently work with bottle ("Fast and simple WSGI-framework for small web-applications"), which is WebApp webserver/middleware used in m101p.

Interestingly this port forwarding does work for the node webserver/middleware used in m101js.


Spoilers Alert!?
----------------

My notes and documentation, does include my solutions and so there are some potential spoilers.... however as most of the answers now appear to be readibly available on Stackoverflow/Blogs/YouTube there are many better indexed and better documented way to cheat on these exams.

This repository is a record of my work and solutions, which may be of interest for others doing this course... but of course you get out of these courses what you put in ;)
